bdir high
bc2 to a0
bc1 to !CS

ðŸ˜„ Then I can try it. Does it currently support VGM playback of 2xPSG?
natalie â€” ä»Šå¤©20:48
it should, i just don't have hardware to test atm
1x opn
2x opn
1x 8910
2x 8910
^ these should work

So for YM2149, do I need to make any modifications to the circuit?
natalie â€” ä»Šå¤©20:50
i believe ym2149 is a 100% drop-in replacement, except the output volume is slightly different, or something like that
there was some sound comparison video on youtube



i don't know the connections for sure at the moment, i have occasional corrupt writes, which could be timing problems, or breadboard problems
right now i have:
BC1 - !CS
BC2 - A0
BDIR - vcc
!SEL - gnd
A8 - vcc
!A9 - gnd
!RESET - !IC
but this might be wrong
it's probably a better idea to do a dedicated 2xPSG megamod. there are compatibility issues between 2203, 2149, and 8910
2149 !SEL must be gnd for compatibility with 2203
but 2149 !SEL as gnd is not compatible with 8910 ("TEST 2" pin on 8910)
setting !SEL to vcc is possible, but then the software needs to use 0.5x clock rate, which is not compatible with 2203
could even do a 4xPSG megamod
